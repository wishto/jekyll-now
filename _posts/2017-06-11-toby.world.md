Welcome to toby.world! The world of toby, This is my personal blog website thingy where I'm gonna post about pretty much anything of note I'm doing. So it'll probably be about things I'm working on, games I've been playing and anime I've been watching.
Honestly the posts will be mostly random stuff. I don't really intend for this to be seen by many people it's more for me to gather my thoughts and keep them recorded somewhere.

The site is hosted through github pages so it's completely free to host. And I've used Jekyll to create the website so I can have a static blog. It took a while to setup as it doesn't have proper Windows support. Now that I have it setup it's quite easy to create posts so I should be able to get these done quite easily. I'm planning to do around 1 post a week which should be easier than any other thing I've planned to do weekly. Making videos weekly is a lot more work than simply making a blog post so I should be able to keep this up.

I've been playing the original Final Fantasy a lot recently so I'll probably make a post about it soon as well as other stuff that I've recently done that I can make posts about.
