A game in space where your ship has taken damage from asteroids causing your cargo to be scattered, you send out your remote controlled transport ship to retrieve it however, the damage has jumbled the controls making it much harder to control.

This game was developed in Unity using C# for the GMTK Game Jam 2020 which had the theme of "Out of Control" and was created in 2 days. All programming and art was created by myself.
It can be found on itch.io [here](https://tobywishart.itch.io/sjs-in-space)
