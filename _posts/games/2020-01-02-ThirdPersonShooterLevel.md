Game level section created in Unreal Engine 4 with assets that I created.

This was a colloborative project with 4 people including I however 2 of our team members did not contribute their level sections to our combined one. I created all of the exterior and the courtyard.

The level was first story boarded which was then used to grey box the level with BSPs in UE4 after that the assets needed were created and replaced the BSPs.
The 3D models were created in 3DS Max and the textures in Photoshop. I created all the materials with the UE4 material editor to achieve the skybox effect and the scrolling textures on the toxic waste and Earth to give them the appearance of motion.
