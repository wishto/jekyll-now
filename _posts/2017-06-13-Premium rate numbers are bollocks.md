So the other day I encountered some bullshit that's really pissed me off. There's these 5 digit phone numbers that receiving from or sending to them will cost you £2.99 known as premium rate numbers. Now I completely understand charging to send messages to these numbers but charging to RECEIVE them, are you fucking kidding me? That would be like if you were sent a letter and when postman gives it to you he says “That'll be £2.99” then you reply “no fuck off I didn't ask for this, charge the fucker that sent this”. Who the fuck decided that this is a good idea clearly people can and are going to abuse this. While we're at it how about we have premium domains where visiting a website with a premium domain will cost ya, just simply make an ad redirect you to their premium domain and fuck you. 

The reason I'm talking about this is because while watching YouTube on my phone I accidentally hit one of the ads on the app and it took me some mobile games site which fuck them I'm not even gonna say their name because no one should be giving them any traffic so I'll call them Piece of Shit Games. So after it loads the site, without me doing ANYTHING, they send me a text saying I'm subscribed to Piece of Shit Games and will be charged £2.99 a week. And that I need to text them STOP to some fucking premium rate number and of course the number that sent the text is premium rate as well. Now there is no way I'm sending a message to those shits so I looked on their website and they had an unsubscribe button which might have unsubscribed me from this shit but I'm having doubts. I also blocked the number however, that does not stop you from being charged. What I have to do is call my provider to block all premium rate numbers and that’ll stop this bullshit and prevent any other bastard from doing this.
So fuck you Piece of Shit Games.

I didn't want to make my first post so negative but this really pissed me off. Next time we'll talk about something much better.
