Bonfires is a mod for Minecraft developed in Java with the Forge API developed by myself with art created by Prophecy_Wrecker. 

The mod implements the mechanics of Bonfires from Dark Souls. Bonfires work as a teleporters that are linked to every Bonfire in the world. In order to adapt the mechanics for Minecraft the UI for the bonfires separates the list of bonfires by dimensions with tabs with support for dimensions added by other mods as well as the existing dimensions in Minecraft.
