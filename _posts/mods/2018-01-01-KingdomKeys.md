Kingdom Keys is a mod for Minecraft developed in Java with the Forge API. It started as a solo project in 2013 but has since expanded to a 4 man team with myself as the lead developer.

Our team consists of:
* Myself, creator and lead programmer, some art.
* Abelatox, programming, Spanish localization.
* Stel312, 3D modelling and some programming.
* Wynd, Some AI programming

The mod add various mechanics from the Kingdom Hearts series to Minecraft. The project has been open source since the beginning and has had various contributions from the community and as this was one of the first projects I publicly released it allowed me to learn a lot about using source control and Java. The source can be found [here](https://github.com/Wehavecookies56/Kingdom-Keys-Re-Coded)

It has been published on CurseForge, the central location for Minecraft mods [here](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/kingdom-keys-re-coded).
